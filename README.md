## Dependencies
All installed packages used in the code for this project are listed in the package.json file of client and server directories

## Motivation
This project was created for the purpose of learning about React.js and Node.js with Express, both frameworks i havent used before at all. I am using this project to learn the fundamentals of both and as I have just started I have many areas i'd like to work on, e.g
- External DB integration (using MongoDB's mongoose)
- Express backend flow (models, controllers, routes etc.)
- API usage in backend (using Plaid API for this project)
- React design fundamentals
- User Authentication (this project uses JWT Authentication)
