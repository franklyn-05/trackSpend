## Roadmap
This project was created for the purpose of learning about React.js and Node.js, both frameworks i havent used before at all. I am using this project to learn the fundamentals
of both and as I have just started I have many areas i'd like to work on, e.g
- Database integration (using MongoDB's mongoose)
- API usage in backend (using Plaid API for this project)
- React fundamentals (started with the server so I have yet to begin working on the client side)
- Authentication
